# Group Project: Brew Bound

## Overview Description
Welcome to Brew Bound!

We have created a web application that helps the Public and Breweries to find each other! We wanted to have a central hub that not only allows for brewereies to publish thier craft beers and ciders, it allows for locals and new patrions to connect and find new breweries to explore!

Please take a look at our prototype at the bottom of this README and all feedback is welcome!

Cheers! üçª
