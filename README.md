# Group Project: Off Leash

## Overview Description
Welcome to Off Leash! 

We have created a web application that helps People and their Furry Companions to be able to enjoy the freedom of being off leash at designated parks and trails! We wanted to provide an easy way for the public to be able to locate these areas in their local communities.
